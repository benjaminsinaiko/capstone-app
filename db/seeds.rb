# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Venue seeds
# venue = Venue.create({venue_name: "Aragon Ballroom", venue_sg_id: 999, venue_lat: 41.96939, venue_lng: -87.65793})
# venue = Venue.create({venue_name: "Riviera Theatre", venue_sg_id: 622, venue_lat: 41.96867, venue_lng: -87.65993})
# venue = Venue.create({venue_name: "The Vic", venue_sg_id: 372, venue_lat: 41.93956, venue_lng: -87.65391})
